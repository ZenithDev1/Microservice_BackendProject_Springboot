# Microservice_BackendProject_Springboot
Microservices backend built with Spring Boot, Docker, Kafka, and Kubernetes for a cloud-native, event-driven architecture.

#Project: Microservice_BackendProject_Springboot
#Status: Ongoing Development

This is a comprehensive Backend Microservices project demonstrating a robust, distributed system architecture. The application is built primarily with Java and the Spring Boot framework, leveraging Hibernate for persistent data management across services.

#Key Architectural Highlights:
     Technology	                    Role in Project
     Microservices Architecture:  	Implemented for modular, independent, and scalable services.
     Java/Spring Boot:             	Core technology stack for building high-performance RESTful APIs.
     Hibernate:                    	Used for reliable Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) and database interaction.
     Apache Kafka:                	The central asynchronous message broker to manage and facilitate event-driven communication between all microservices,
                                      ensuring high decoupling and resilience.
     Docker:                       	Used for containerization of each individual microservice, standardizing environments and simplifying deployment.
     Kubernetes(K8s): 	            Employed for orchestration and management of the Docker containers, enabling automated scaling, load balancing, 
                                      and high availability in a production-like environment.
     Git:                          	Used for version control, maintaining a clear development history, and daily code uploads to track project evolution.
